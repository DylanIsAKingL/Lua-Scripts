# introduction
Howdy ðŸ‘‹! I make __lua__ stuff, specifically __Roblox scripts__.

All the __code__ in this __repository__ belongs to me!

As god said
> please stop stealing code - *God*

I'm open for script requests, __[click here](https://discordapp.com/users/717369125965398027).__

also I only upload my scripts to __[my scriptblox](https://scriptblox.com/u/DylanIsAKing)__ so if you find me somewhere else, *__that ain't me!__*

Also __[@Rogahn47958](https://rbxscript.com/api/profile/view/756439257287098429)__ stop uploading my scripts to __[rblxscripts.com](https://rbxscript.com/)__ like wtf is __[this](https://rbxscript.com/post/MySchoolTycoonSafeCodeFinder-Uy3mx)__
